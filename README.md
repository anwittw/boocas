# Boocas

> A modern, digital approach to creating a bookclub

## The Idea

Imagine, you are reading '*1984 - by George Orwell*', a book which fascinated generations of readers for more than seven decades. You are moved by it's relevance to nowadays political situation - and you want to share those thoughts.

Boocas is for people, who not only want to *consume a book*, but to share their personal interpretation and the learnings they take from it.

 Here you are able to create groups to discuss a particular book, idea or Thought. 

## Under the hood

Boocas is created as a Full-Stack-Application, embracing the **mobile-first-paradigma**.

While an customized **express.js** installation serves as the **API** of the Project , the Frontend Application is created with **React.js**. 

All the Data is stored in a no-sql **MongoDB** configured with **mongoose**.

Among others **bCrypt**, **axios** and **passport** have been used in the backend.

The UI was created using **Reactstrap** to apply **Bootstrap** in Form of React Components. In addition to that **React's Effects and States** where used. Also, individual styling was applied to smoothen up the user experience.
